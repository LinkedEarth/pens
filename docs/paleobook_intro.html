<p>This PaleoBook gathers notebooks for the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0101.1"><em>&quot;Temporal Comparisons Involving Paleoclimate Data Assimilation: Challenges &amp; Remedies&quot;</em></a>, by Julien Emile-Geay, Gregory J. Hakim, Frederi Viens, Feng Zhu and Daniel E. Amrhein.</p>
<p>There are two main uses to these notebooks:
1) <strong>Understand the genesis and properties of a new tool</strong> introduced in the paper, called <strong>&quot;plume distance&quot;</strong>, which is broadly applicable to all manner of ensembles as used in climate science (broadly defined). Indeed, while the article focused on paleoclimate reconstruction ensembles (particularly those generated by &quot;offline&quot; data assimilation methods), the plume distance can help quantify distance between timeseries generated by initial condition ensembles (e.g. like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0731-2">those</a>), observational ensembles obtained by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0901.1">resampling</a>, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2007.2076">any other kind</a> (e.g. perturbed parameter ensembles).</p>
<p>2) <strong>Reproduce figures from the paper</strong>, which showcases several useful Python packages to do paleoclimatology in the Cloud, including <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pens/">pens</a>, <a href="https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html#">xarray</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util">Pyleoclim</a>.</p>
